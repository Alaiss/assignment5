        <h4><u>Explanation:</u></h4>
        <p> From the assignment document, I understood that the audio that I'm to make should be working together with a
            video later on.
            That's why I decided to record the audio of a story and later on supply it with still images. I added some
            background music
            that changes as the story progresses because the audio would sound very raw and uninteressting if it was
            just the sound of my voice,
            it's done to add a flavour to the recording (a lot of bloggers do it too) as well as to change the mood of
            the narrative. <br/>
            I found a website with free to use and download audio recordings and picked out 4 music clips that I thought
            were best suited for my purpose.
            The first one is a happy and peaceful one, for the beginning. Second one has a bit of a dangerous sound,
            third one - heroic and a bit of a "ready-to-fight" kind of soundtrack,
            the fourth one - energetic and cheerful. With the help of Audacity as a tool, I mixed up all these
            recordings, plus the recording of my voice telling the story,
            in a single audio. It also helped me to get rid of some unnecessary sounds in my recording. Then, I used Win
            Movie Maker to make a video from my still images, after which I layed a final recording over it.
            As for the images, because of the kind of story I made up, I thought that it'd be easier to take the
            pictures using my camera instead of looking for them on the Internet.
        </p>
        <h4><u>Reflection:</u></h4>
        <p>
            I didn't have any problems with creating a story because there weren't a lot of restrictions on the kind of
            story it's supposed to be.
            Getting the images wasn't a problem too, because I took all of them with my own camera. It was somewhat hard
            to find the suitable
            audio clips that are free to use. I had to look throught a couple of websites before I found something close
            to what I was looking for.
            Audacity turned out to be a very helpful tool, very intuitive and easy to use. (Insert here iff win movie
            create smth w/ a watermark).
            I had to download win movie maker to make the video itself but all I had to do was to select the pictures
            that I wanted to make a video with.
            The common difficulty that both video and audio edditing has is the timings; it's very important to be
            precise with them, to know
            when an image or an audio needs to be changed and that requires a lot of attentiveness.
            Last part was exporting a video from the Win Movie Maker - that took more than 2 hours.
        </p>
        <p>The general steps for video creation using Win Movie Maker are:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Obtain all the material that you would like to include: audio, video, text, image.</li>
            <li>Import all of them into the program that you'll be working in (Win Movie Maker, in our case).</li>
            <li>Edit the material. </li>
            <li>Save your project. </li>
            <li>Export your project as a video and save it in the format and place of your choice. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            I rate the difficulty of this assignment 7/10.

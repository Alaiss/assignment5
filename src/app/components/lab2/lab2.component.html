    <div id="heh2">
        <p> Hello everyone!</p>
        <p> My name is Inna and I'm currently in the process of getting my Honours Bachelor of
            Technology - Software Development degree.
            I'm in the third year of my program. I decided to become a software developer because it's interesting,
            challenging and involves constant learning.
            <p>
                My favourite classes so far were mostly C++ related, although I also enjoy learning about project
                development a lot.
                I'd love to come up with an innovative design of my own application in the near future. One of my best
                qualities is ability to quickly grasp new technologies.
                The most recent example of that is the android application that I'm currently working on with a friend.
                I
                didn't have any classes on Android development prior the start of this project. In spite of that, our
                core
                functionality is already working without any problems!
            </p>
            <p>
                In my spare time I enjoy learning new things, reading, mostly, classic literature, playing video games,
                talking to interesting people and playing video games.
            </p>
            <p>
                I currently know two languages: Russian and English; but I'm attending German classes on saturday
                mornings
                because I want to be able to speak german as well.
                My favourite authors are: John Steinbeck, Carlos Castaneda, Victor Hugo and Carl Jung. The novel I've
                enjoyed reading most in the last five years is <i>East of Eden</i>.
                I also take a great joy in paintings and my most admirable painter is Van Gogh. I believe that his work
                is
                not only loved for its unique style but for his hearbreaking life story and a great personality as
                well.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here's one of the quotes that I have a great appreciation for:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                The only people for me are the mad ones, the ones who are mad to live, mad to talk, mad to be saved,
                desirous of everything at the same time, the ones who never yawn or say a commonplace thing, but burn,
                burn, burn like fabulous yellow roman candles exploding like spiders across the stars.
